# SeChat
Chat program written in Java, final builds will be encrypted to make it "Secure Chat" hence SeChat
Multiplatform Capability out of box is what the objective is.

UPDATES:
     Currently programming a backend controller in JAVA on a front facing server. JDBC control will be completely removed from the client program. Instead ServerSocket and Socket connections planned for use concerning login/authentication and chatting. 
     
     This client program here will not be updated until I am finished with backend.
