1. The Server
1.1 The Binding
     In order for MySQL to accept any incoming connections on the IP level it must first know where to listen for them.
You can do this by settinging the addresses it can bind to. 

     In /etc/mysql/my.cnf move to the line for binding-address
     
     Make sure it is uncommented and make the address 0.0.0.0
     (This is the default to accept all connections)

     Restart MySQL by typing sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop
                             sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start

     If MySQL fails to start either from command line by typing mysql
     or by /etc/init.d/mysql start refer to 1.3 a. MySQL will not start
